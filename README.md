The **SportsPlus API** is a RESTful API designed to manage various entities in a sports information system, including players, teams, matches, schedules, statistics, and more. Built with **Node.js and Express**, this API provides a scalable and efficient way to handle sports-related data and operations.  

## Introduction  

This API follows the **REST architectural principles**, enabling seamless communication between different software systems in a structured and standardized way. It facilitates the information of sports events, player records, match schedules.

## Principles of REST Architecture  

- **Client-Server Architecture:** Separation of client and server roles for better scalability.

- **State Transfer:** JSON format is used for data exchange between client and server.  

## Tech Stack
